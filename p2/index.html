            <h4>Step One</h4>
            <p>
                Explaination. Solving regex crossword puzzles is hard. There is a lot you have to think about. I will go under the assumption you know regex. Otherwise
                get a online cheatsheet and start refrencing. Let's look at the top left box. There you look up, down, left, and right to find out what is possible.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Top Left. The left regex says the first one has to be either O, N, E. The top and right says . which means any character not spaces. The bottom says
                it has to start with N, F, A. Since the left and button rule out everything but N, it becomes N. You also might as well put the F on the 
                Left Middle row so you don't forget.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bottom Left. The left side of this one says it has to be an A so it is put down as such.
            </p>

            <h4>Step Two</h4>
            <p>
                Middle. This one is easy so we will continue on with it. If you look at the left it says it has to be RE or ER, but the bottom says it has to
                start with A, E, I. Since only one start with E, it is E. Make sure to put R into the middle right so you don't forget.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bottom Middle. Since we know that the middle is E. The top regex says they are all groups and only one starts with E. So we put T down for it.
                This fits with the left and right regex. The Entire middle row could not be TEA because the top row can't Have a T in it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Top Middle. The last for this step is the top middle as it is also easy since we know the buttom ones. The top regex are all in groups but we 
                only have room for one. So it is one of the one letter groupings. The left and right Regex says it cannot be P. So that only leaves O. Put in O.
            </p>

            <h4>Step Three</h4>
            <p>
                Bottom Right. The bottom regex states the letters have to be Either S, U, P, E, R. The left regex gets rid of all of them except U.
                The top and right regex also have a U so put in a U.
            </p>
            <p>
                Top Right. The left regex says the letter has be either S, K, A. The right regex says it has to be O or S which means only S is a option. The 
                top and bottom regex allow it. Put in a S and you are done.
