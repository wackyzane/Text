    <center><h1 style="margin-top: 25px;">Explanation</h1></center>
    <hr>
    <p>
        1. To start this Explanation, I first need to explain that we need out html set up in a specific way. 
        We set up a div with id being page so we can put all our added elements in it.
        Next we put some margin on top and bottom in another div right under it. 
        Now we make a div with an id of wrap that contains everything else we make.
        This div will make it possible to hide our element creator later on.
        Then we made the actual show of the element adder. 
        We put in a div with a Bootstrap card with a background that is dark, margin that is auto set and a width that is 75%.
        Next we put the title of JavaScript that has the class card-header(to section off the card) and text-light to make the text white on black background.
        We the span that and give the JavaScript some customization and put an X at the right side with a colored button and a onclick element to close the box.
        Next we section off another piece of the card to body so we can put out 5 different inputs to make the elements.
        These all are waiting to be submitted by the buttons under which have onclick elements for creating, removing and resetting.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Now we continue on to the actual JS.
        First we make two variables using Const, that grab all the inputs on the page and grab the page div so we can put in elements to that div.
        We also make an empty variable called parent with let.
        Now we are out first function called create_Ele();
        First we create a new variable called element that is set to the first input tagName. (like h1, p, div, etc.)
        We now make a for loop and in it we make a variable called attribute that grabs whatever input it is on and takes the placeholder. (It is set to whatever loop it is on)
        Also make a another variable called value that takes the value of the input it is on.
        Next we make an if statement where if something is typed in, replace the placeholder with the value.
        Then we make another on where if the attribute is equal to the parent ID and the value, make a variable called div that is set to whatever the value you placed in.
        Then append that and put in the new tag you just made.
        Escentually you have just checked to see if you asked to put your new tag into another div you have made and if so you put it into it.
        Otherwise it will just put it into the premade div called page.
        Lastly we make out variable parent equal to the div we are currently in, which is usually page unless you make another div inside.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. This will be a short one as explaining the remove is very simple and only has two lines.
        The first line in the function remove_Ele(); is to make a variable called last_child.
        This variable grabs the last element made in parent we set before.
        Then we remove it with remove();.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Next we have reset which is another short function.
        Make a for loop and in it make all the input's value equal to blank.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. The second to last function is the hide function called hide_Ele();.
        First we make a variable called wrap that is equal to the id wrap we have on our page.
        We add a class to wrap called d-none which is in bootstrap to show nothing.
        Next we make another variable that is called show_btn and in it we make a element of span with this variable.
        We then set the text of the span to Show Panel, we set the id to sBtn, we make the class into bootstrap with btn btn-primary m-5 mt-5, and lastly we make an attribute called onclick which is set to show_Ele();.
        Last thing we do it place our button into the div page so we can get rid of it.        
    </p>
    <p>
        6. This is the last function called show_Ele();.
        First we make a variable called wrap that is equal to the id wrap we have on our page.
        We add a class to wrap called d-block to show all the code we had hidden.
        Then we set btn to the id sBtn we set in hide.
        We make another variable called p_btn and set it to the div it is in.
        Then we remove our child called btn.
