      <h1>How to use Node.js</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="item3">
      <h4>Explanation</h4>
      <p>
        1. Make a new folder called MERN. Here we will place all the files
        we will use to make a database. The first thing we will make is
        a program saying hello world. Right click in MERN and open a terminal.
        From here you will type in "gedit node_test_001.js". In the folder
        type in what I have in the picture, what it does is set variables,
        then makes the server on localhost:8080. On the page is some text with
        the current time. Try copying it to see how it works. (Click Picture to enlarge)
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Node doesn't like using \' to use the '. So just dont do it. Join is used to link two different things into one table.
        We used it to link names and species of an animal and also the owner. You can add as many things as you want and order how you like.
        Everything we learned is in the picture in the 'var sql=" "'.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. We did a three table join which is like the the text above but instead we have a third table in it.
        This is the mysql instead of node. The import lines are 92 to 95, they show how we minpulated the code.
        We had to add the section of the table in select. Then specify the first,
        which is customer. The last two lines show which table it is connected too
        and how it is connected. At the end of line 95, it has what we are specifing, so we had
        where the species is dog and the gender of the dog is a male. Like just says it can but doesn't have to be capitalized.

        4. The entity relationship diagram shows each table and its components.
        It shows which components are primary keys and foreign keys, and which can accept no answer or must be answered.
        Lastly it shows how each table is connected to the other tables.
        For example customer is linked to animal through a line which end with 3 splits into animal.
        It shows that one component from customer(IDcustomer), can be connected to multiple other keys in the animal table.
        The keys connect each other.

        5. There is two ways to put in Find(). The first is through node.js by making a file filed with what is in the picture,
        the other is by typing in the commands that are in the picture of the command console.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        6. type what ever is on the attached picture into mongo from the command console.
        The only thing that might not make sense is upsert true which means that if the name is not found,
        put it in.
      </p>

        7. How to scuff machine with compass. Step one get into your command console and type in the commands you see in the picture.
        Step to is to open compass. If it doesn't break your VM, good for you, if it does try making it a icon on the desktop and it might
        fix it for you.
      </p>

        8. To do a find in mongodb you need to put in db.(collection).find({filter},{projection},{cursor modifier});
        You put in your own collection without the () for your code.
        Filter is what you are looking for, whether a name or something else. You leave the {} with this and the other two.
        For projection you can leave it blank. It says what to show by setting them to one and zero with the auto being everything shown (set to one).
        The cursor modifier you want to sort it. You can also add .pretty(); at the end to make it look better.
      </p>

      <p>
        9. Regex in mongo isn't complicated if you already know regex. I will go under the assumption you know regex. If you don't you can use a regex
        cheatsheet online to know what each symbol does. After you have put in what your type your searching for like "name" or "age" and have a : after it
        you can start your regex with a / and end it with another /. You can put normal regex in the middle and it will look for it like that. You don't need 
        anything like the $and before it.
